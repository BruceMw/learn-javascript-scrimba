let largeCountries = ["Tuvalu","India","USA","Indonesia","Monaco"]

// You need to help me fixup the largeCountries array so that 
// China and Pakistan are added back into their respective places
// Use push() & pop() and their counterparts unshift() & shift()

largeCountries.pop()
largeCountries.shift()
largeCountries.unshift("China")
largeCountries.push("Pakistan")
console.log(largeCountries)
// how to use unshift() and shift(): these work with the beginning of the array. Pop() push() works with the end of the array.
